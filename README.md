# Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’°

This project focuses on analyzing and preparing a car resale dataset to build a **machine learning model** that predicts car prices. The notebook covers data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
The dataset (`cardekho.csv`) contains used car listings with attributes such as:
- **name** â€“ Car model name (brand + variant)  
- **year** â€“ Manufacturing year  
- **selling_price** â€“ Target variable, car resale value (in INR â‚¹)  
- **km_driven** â€“ Kilometers driven  
- **fuel** â€“ Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)  
- **seller_type** â€“ Type of seller (Individual, Dealer, Trusted Dealer)  
- **transmission** â€“ Manual or Automatic  
- **owner** â€“ Ownership history (First, Second, etc.)  
- **mileage, engine, max_power, seats** â€“ Technical specifications

## ðŸ”Ž Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Steps performed:
1. **Handle Missing Values**  
   - Dropped rows with missing target (`selling_price`).  
   - Imputed missing `mileage` values with column mean.  

2. **Duplicates**  
   - Removed duplicate rows to avoid bias in training.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Converted `year` â†’ `car_age` for better prediction.  
   - Normalized categorical columns (`fuel`, `seller_type`, `transmission`, `owner`).  

4. **Consistency Checks**  
   - Fixed inconsistent casing in categorical features.  
   - Verified unique values before encoding.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution of selling prices, mileage, and engine sizes.  
- Relationship between car age, kilometers driven, and resale value.  
- Impact of fuel type and transmission on price.  

---

## ðŸ¤– Modeling Potential
- Supervised learning: Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Feature importance analysis for price drivers.  
- Potential extension: Deploy as a price prediction web app.
